# Big Shell (Bish)
Big shell is a structured shell that is capable of parsing and executing input in order to run programs. Big shell supports powerful IO redirection, with fully featured input/output files as well as piping between programs. The ability to suspend and continue programs is added for convenience. The shell contains several built in commands (ex. exit, jobs, fg X) in order to facilitate shell usage.
